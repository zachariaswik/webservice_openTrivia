# Adaptive Quiz project [WORKING PROJECT]

Take data from the open trivia database - and create a small game type of learning.
The difficulty of the questions will be either upgraded or downgraded adaptively based on a learning algorithm.

This repo will contain the following parts:

## user-interface
User input, graphic interface, output, etc.  
Progression from working solution to more complex solution:
# 1. Text based input / output. 
# 2. Simple GUI
# 3. Advanced GUI

## learning algorithm
Background processes related to learning. Adaptive learning algorithm choosing the difficulty grade of the questions. 
# 1. Simple algorithm (start with easy -> 2 correct answers moves you up one level / 2 incorrect moves you down)
# 2. More advanced adaption algorithm (something like reinforcement learning) 

## webservice
Handle requests to the trivia URL endpoint "https://opentdb.com/".  [more or less done]
